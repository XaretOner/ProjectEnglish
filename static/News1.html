			<p>As the exam season commences, students may be enticed to utilize new artificial intelligence (AI) tools to gain an advantage in assessments.</p>

			<p>In an effort to comprehend the capabilities of AI applications such as ChatGPT and introduce guidelines on their use, universities have been scrambling. And now, they are being encouraged to teach students how to use them.</p>

			<p>Academics at the University of Bath have been considering the challenges and opportunities associated with this technology.</p>

			<p>James Fern, speaking about ChatGPT - an online tool that can respond to questions, including generating essays and emails, using language that resembles that of humans - stated, "Our first question was, 'Could this be used by students to answer our assessment questions?'"</p>

			<p>"It handles multiple-choice questions very well, for example."</p>

			<p>"We definitely were not expecting it to perform as well as it did... it was getting close to 100% accuracy."</p>

			<p>However, with more intricate questions, which necessitate critical thinking and make up the majority of assessments, it struggles.</p>

			<p>One example, taken from a final-year assessment, reads: "why time management in teenagers' lives is very important and needed?"</p>
