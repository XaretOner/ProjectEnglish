			<h2>This new browser is shocking...</h2>
			<p>Opera has announced the launch of its new browser, Opera One, which is expected to replace the company's current flagship desktop browser later this year.</p>

			<p>The new browser comes with a few updates, including an overhauled user interface (UI), integration with AI chatbots, and improved tab management features.</p>

			<p>The updated design of Opera One features more rounded shapes for UI elements such as tabs, address bar, and sidebar. While it is not a complete redesign, much of the UI, particularly the design and layout of menus, is identical to the current version of the browser.</p>

			<p>One of the key improvements of Opera One is its multithreaded compositor, which Opera claims is a first for any major Chromium-based browser. This enhances the performance of UI animations, of which the new browser has plenty.</p>

			<p>Furthermore, Opera has also integrated ChatGPT and ChatSonic within its sidebar feature, allowing users to open both services in a small window on the side. Additionally, there is an integrated AI Prompts feature that provides suggestions to shorten the article, highlight the point, create a tweet, create a meme idea, etc. about the current page's content using one of the aforementioned services, and these options change based on the page.</p>
	
			<p>Although Opera One is not a significant departure from the existing Opera browser, it has been marketed with buzzwords such as AI and modularity.</p>

			<p>The browser is currently available in an 'early access' version and is set to replace the standard Opera for Windows, macOS, and Linux sometime later this year.</p>
